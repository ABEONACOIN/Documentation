**Introduction**

Many people find pleasure in traveling. It is inconceivable for them to sit in one place all their lives. They are full of the desire to see and learn new things. Perhaps they still have a passion for adventure.

Others combine tourism with rest. They often want to step back from the usual business of work, and maybe even acquaintances, finding themselves in a place where they will not be disturbed, and they can enjoy pleasantly. Plenty of people traveling for work, others to try the national cuisine of different peoples or just to improve their health.

Moreover, they all know some concerns about preparing for such travels. If this is another country, then you need to think about the local currency or issue a credit card. But no matter how carefully we did not prepare, we can still face unforeseen expenses.

Have you ever thought that there might be a currency whose value grows with time and over time you can afford more purchases or services? And this currency does not even need to be physically carried with you and even on a credit card. Moreover, in any country, you can send or receive this currency in your own hands in the form of local money. And, at the same time, get bonuses for all your expenses in the form of a refund of part of the funds spent. Abeona Coin (ABN) designed for such purposes. Moreover, it will tie you to a whole platform of useful functions, called Adiona.


_The Emergence of the Idea_

As a founder, I will share the origin of the concept.

I travel a lot around the world and have visited many countries. I believe that travel enriches a person's life. I like to get acquainted with the cultures of different peoples, try their cuisine and familiarise myself with new people.

At the moment, many services facilitate travel. Despite this, a lot of effort and time is spent on preparing for them. Moreover, I had an idea of why not combining all the services into one and using the blockchain technology for this.

After all, when traveling, we usually spend money, but here, when developing a new platform, coins will be required for the system to work. Thus, the value of currencies will grow over time, and it turns out that, by using the platform, we promote its popularity, including with business owners (as they receive income from us) and travelers. 

Also, when spending, we will win bonuses in the form of coins. It will be cheaper to manage services as we will communicate with business owners directly without intermediaries.

So, what do we get as a result? 

We spend money on trips, but our means do not decrease, but on the contrary grow.

For a year in the sphere of tourism, a turnover of trillions of dollars made. Moreover, having reached our immediate goal to take a piece from this turnover, namely $ 20 billion, which is a little fraction of the pie, our coins can achieve a cost of $ 10 each. The original price of the token is only 10 cents. That is, we have the prospect of increasing our investments by a hundred times. In turn, it turns out that we have the opportunity to travel for free. How?


For example, you invest $ 10,000 in a coin and purchase 100,000 ABN. 

As the platform popularised and as a consequence of the currency, its value will go up. 

By the end of next year, we plan to complete all work on the preparation and launch of the platform. By this time, we expect that the coin's value will already reach $ 1, and in the end, our goal is $ 10. 

You will travel and, in the end, when you look at your wallet depending on how generously you were spending and will see only 10,000 ABN, then you may be sad. 

However, these 10,000 ABN will then cost about 100,000 dollars. That is, you have invested only $ 10,000 and, during this time, you could have spent nearly half a million dollars on travel, and you still have $ 100,000 in your wallet.

We have much work ahead of us and rest assured that we will do our best to make your aspirations come true.



**Abeona Coin** 

Goddess Abeona, in Roman mythology, was considered the patroness of those who have left their homes. In addition to protecting travelers, she also defended the first steps of young children. 

Her assistant was Goddess Adiona or Adeona (in Latin, Adeona). She was called the goddess of safe return. 

Together, they help the wanderers on their way. Abeona at the time of departure, and Adiona when they decide to go home.

It is very symbolic that in ancient Rome, as today, travel was associated with some difficulties and people needed protection. Today, we will also be happy with any support that our platform, prepared with a caring heart, can provide.

The new system is designed to make not only your journey but perhaps your entire life more comfortable and less expensive.


Abeona is a cryptocurrency; the settlement unit of the Adiona blockchain platform.

The Adiona platform is an integrated ecosystem where the functions of a trading platform and a communication service realized simultaneously. 



Abeona will tie into all aspects of the functionality of the Adiona platform, which will allow users both to spend tokens on products or services and to provide services or sell their own through the system. 

Users will be able to make settlements among themselves, using Abeona tokens as a settlement instrument.


The Abeona project will encourage users to store Abeona tokens in their purses inside the system. The Abeona token is the core of the Adiona ecosystem. As the platform develops, its partners will use Abeona tokens more and more. 

That will extend the functionality of the coins and will significantly increase the coverage of the ecosystem, giving more and more users the opportunity to communicate with each other and interact for any purpose.

Abeona is an ERC20 token released on the Ethereum platform, with 2,000,000,000 tokens issued.

**Blockchain Platform Adiona**

To date, there are significant platforms for booking hotels and private apartments, and for buying tourist passes and air tickets. Often the commissions paid by business owners to these intermediaries are high, and they also fall on the shoulders of clients.

The decentralized platform Adiona solves this problem.
The revolutionary platform will include decentralized systems for booking and buying tickets and air tickets. The need for intermediary companies eliminated.
The Adiona platform will allow business owners to get more revenue, and customers will have fewer expenses.

For example, the average commission for hotels in booking.com is 15% of the booking. Healthy competition in the provision of services, a decentralized rating and feedback system will contribute to the quality of the services provided and, at the same time, the choice will be far more excellent.

Moreover, it is noteworthy that, in this whole system, one common global currency created for this platform. 

And it will be Abeona.

**Payment Card** 

But to fully take full advantage of the Abeona coins, payment cards are provided.

Thanks to payment cards, there will be no need for the trip to exchange our ABN coins for ordinary money and transfer them to cards. When shopping for travel or at home, ABN will automatically convert to the currency you need to purchase. Moreover, there will be good bonuses and discounts when using the card, both on the Adiona platform and with regular purchases. Thus, you can keep your funds in investments that will eventually grow in value, and you will be able to spend them at any time you need.


**Decentralized Exchange** 

Sometimes it may be necessary for us to exchange one cryptocurrency for another. And for this will be created a decentralized crypto exchange.

The decentralized exchange is the future of the cryptocurrency space. We are already familiar with the shortcomings of the centralized cryptoсurrency exchanges. Already, some marketplaces do not depend on the will of a group of people, and so participants can exchange the cryptocurrency without any extra middlemen.

Such an exchange will make it possible at any time to exchange the Abeona Coin to another cryptocurrency and vice-versa.


**P2P Platform** 

A peer-to-peer (P2P) service is a decentralized platform whereby two individuals interact directly with each other, without intermediation by a third-party. Instead, the buyer and the seller transact directly with each other via the P2P service.

That is, being in any country you can change your Abeona coins for ordinary money and vice versa exchange regular money for coins. You can also choose a convenient way to receive money.


**Desktop and Mobile Applications**


For the convenience of using the platform, exchange, and coins, will create mobile and desktop applications. The app will combine the platform (including booking and online purchases), cards, exchange, coins and other useful functions.

Thanks to the application, all operations will be carried out quickly and easily.


**Development Strategy**


To date, there are many services and platforms designed to make travel convenient. Few people have not heard of or used such services as Booking.com, Skyscanner, and Uber. Technologies are developing, and they will be replaced by more advanced systems that combine a set of services based on a decentralized block of ordinary money with its universal currency. That will save our resources and strengths since such a system facilitates planning and saves our time.
Such a platform will become Adiona. Be part of a new revolution in technology that will fundamentally change our lives. Steps will be taken to develop the project and be sure of its success, so the team that works on it are themselves inveterate travelers and are obsessed with the desire to bring new people into the habitual way.
The development of the project will base on the following steps:
...

Creating a decentralized blockchain platform 
an attraction of business owners 
The issue of a payment card
Building applications
Building a P2P platform
Own decentralized exchange
Listing on large exchanges
...

In the course of time, you will also learn about new directions and goals that the team sets itself. That will be a big surprise for all investors and fans of the platform. 

**Terms of ICO** 

During the ICO half of the coins will be distributed. That will be enough to implement the original intentions.

3% will allocate to bonus rewards.

12% will award to the remuneration of team members in the form of ABN coins.

35% of tokens will be frozen for further development and maintenance of the platform. These coins will be wholly frozen until stable coins are worth more than $ 1 within six months.

Reserved coins will be used to keep the entire system in working order and will not sell on the stock exchange. Individual investors can purchase them outside the exchange transaction. So, this in no way will affect the value of coins.

All this will mean that investors do not suffer and, at the same time, the platform develops.
